The "Co-op Compass" platform is a unique, data-driven platform for Northeastern students
to gain valuable insights into co-op positions, going beyond what standard job postings offer.

 When applying for co-ops, students often lack transparency around work culture, compensation, and the true nature of job responsibilities.
 Our app fills these gaps by collecting and analyzing reviews on salary information and work experiences from previous co-op students, offering a 
 comprehensive picture that empowers applicants to make more informed decisions.

Our four main user personasâ€”Applicants, Previous Co-ops, Employers, and Adminâ€”each benefit from tailored features. 
Applicants can explore authentic peer reviews, Previous Co-ops can easily share their insights, and Employers can showcase their brand
through verified information as well as oversee trends regarding their company. Moreover, Admins can regulate content and users, to uphold the
functionality and guidelines within the app. With features like salary transparency, job satisfaction scores, and advanced filters, "Co-Op Compass" bridges the information gap,
providing students with a clearer path to co-op opportunities that match their aspirations and values.
